# AATMF v2 – Adversarial AI Threat Modeling Framework

**Author:** Kai Aizen (SnailSploit)  
**Latest Release:** v2.0 (August 10, 2025)  
**Status:** Active  
**License:** CC BY-SA 4.0

## 📌 Overview
The **Adversarial AI Threat Modeling Framework (AATMF)** is an attacker-driven methodology for testing, measuring, and hardening **AI/LLM systems**.  
It is the direct evolution of the [AiPTF/AATMF]([https://github.com/SnailSploit/Adverserial-Ai-Framework](https://github.com/SnailSploit/Aversarial-AI-Threat-Modeling-Framwork/blob/main/AATMF_v.1_2023.md)) project, with major improvements including:

- **14 unified tactics** covering prompt injection, poisoning, RAG manipulation, agent exploitation, and more.  
- **Quantitative risk scoring (AATMF-R)**: Likelihood × Impact × Detectability × Recoverability.  
- **Red-Card evaluations**: reproducible YAML scenarios for CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Crosswalk mappings** to industry standards: OWASP LLM Top-10, NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATLAS.  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
Clone the repository and run a sample Red-Card evaluation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailSploit/Aversarial-AI-Threat-Modeling-Framwork.git
cd AATMF/tools
python redcard-runner.py --scenario ../eval/redcards/RS-002.yaml
```

Expected output: detection of an indirect prompt injection attempt with KPIs logged (block rate, latency, ASR).

## 📊 Tactics Overview
| Tactic | Focus Area | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **T1** | Prompt & Context Subversion | System prompt override |
| **T4** | Multi-Turn & Memory Manipulation | Incremental jailbreak assembly |
| **T7** | Output Manipulation & Exfiltration | Chain-of-thought interrogation |
| **T12** | RAG / Knowledge Base Poisoning | Contaminated KB injection |
| **T14** | Infra-Economics Abuse | Cost amplification (Denial-of-Wallet) |

Full list available in `/docs/implementation-guide.md`.
